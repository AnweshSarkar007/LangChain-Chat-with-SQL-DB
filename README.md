LangChain: Chat with SQL DB

Interact with your SQL databases using **natural language** instead of writing SQL queries.
This project integrates **LangChain** with an **LLM (Large Language Model)** to let you ask questions like:

👉   Show me the top 5 students with the highest marks in Data Science.
👉   List all students in section A scoring above 85.

The system automatically:

1. Converts your question into SQL
2. Executes it on the connected database
3. Returns results in a conversational format

✨ Features

* Natural Language Queries – No SQL knowledge required
* Automatic SQL Generation – AI translates text into SQL
* Interactive Database Exploration – Get results instantly
* LangChain Integration – Harness LLM-powered reasoning
* Extensible – Works with SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.
* Beginner-Friendly – Simple setup and usage

🛠️ Tech Stack

* Python 3.9+
* LangChain – LLM orchestration
* SQLite / MySQL / PostgreSQL – Database support
* Streamlit – User interface (optional)
* OpenAI API (or other LLMs) – For natural language understanding
