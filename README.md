LangChain: Chat with SQL DB

Interact with your SQL databases using **natural language** instead of writing SQL queries.
This project integrates **LangChain** with an **LLM (Large Language Model)** to let you ask questions like:

👉 *“Show me the top 5 students with the highest marks in Data Science.”*
👉 *“List all students in section A scoring above 85.”*

The system automatically:

1. Converts your question into SQL
2. Executes it on the connected database
3. Returns results in a conversational format

✨ Features

* 🗣️ Natural Language Queries** – No SQL knowledge required
* ⚡ Automatic SQL Generation** – AI translates text into SQL
* 📊 Interactive Database Exploration** – Get results instantly
* 🔗 LangChain Integration** – Harness LLM-powered reasoning
* 🛠️ Extensible** – Works with SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.
* 🎯 Beginner-Friendly** – Simple setup and usage

🛠️ Tech Stack

* Python 3.9+
* LangChain – LLM orchestration
* SQLite / MySQL / PostgreSQL – Database support
* Streamlit – User interface (optional)
* OpenAI API (or other LLMs) – For natural language understanding
